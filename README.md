# flo-to-drip-converter

Small simple jupyter notebook that can convert the data retrieved by a gdpr request from the flo menstrual cycle tracking app into a format than can be imported into the drip menstural cycle tracking app - which is waaay more privacy friendly.

No License since I didn't want to research the license of the included python libraries.
Feel free to do with it whatever you want, I take no responsibility for anything.
